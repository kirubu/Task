5. Write a Java program to remove the duplicate elements of a given array and return the new length of the array.
	Sample array: [20, 20, 30, 40, 50, 50, 50]
	50 3times present in array
	20 2times present in arry
	After removing the duplicate elements the program should return 4 as the new length of the array.

4. Write a Java program to find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence from a given unsorted array of integers.
	Sample array: [49, 1, 3, 200, 2, 4, 70, 5] 
	The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], therefore the program will return its length 5.
