The program adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides simple integers. When the program is run, it zeros the result register and displays its contents. The user can then type in an operator and number. The result is updated and displayed. The following operators are valid:
Operator 	Meaning
+ 		Addition
-	        	Subtraction
*               	Multiplication
/               	Division
Example (user input is in boldface)
calc
Result: 0
Enter operator and number: + 123
Result: 123
Enter operator and number: - 23
Result: 100
Enter operator and number: / 25
Result: 4
Enter operator and number: * 4
Result: 16
Program to clear the specified bit of a number.
Write a C++ program to which reads an integer n and prints a twin prime which has the maximum size among twin primes less than or equals to n. 
According to wikipedia "A twin prime is a prime number that is either 2 less or 2 	
more than another prime number" for example, either member of the twin prime 
pair (41, 43). In other words, a twin prime is a prime that has a prime gap of two".
Program to check the two given numbers are same or equal without using any comparison operator.
Program to print series using function: x + x^3/3! + x^5/5! +â€¦â€¦.+ x^n/n!
Write a C++ program to which reads n digits chosen from 0 to 9 and counts the number of combinations where the sum of the digits equals to given number. Do not use the same digits in a combination. 
For example, the combinations where n = 2 and s = 5 are as follows:
0 + 5 = 5
1 + 4 = 5
3 + 2 = 5
