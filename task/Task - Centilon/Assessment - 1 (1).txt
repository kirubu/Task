has the following three instance variables:
title, which is a String representing the title of the film
production, which is a String representing the studio that made the movie
rating, which is a String representing the rating of the movie (i.e. PG­13, R, etc)
	public class Film {
		private String title;
		private String production;
		private String rating;
		// your code goes here

a) Write a constructor for the class Film, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, a String representing the production, and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class variables to these values.

b) Write a second constructor for the class Film, which takes a String representing the title of the movie and a String representing the production as its arguments, and sets the respective class variables to these values, while the class variable rating is set to "PG".

c) Write a method getPGRating, which takes an array of base type Film as its argument, and returns a new array of only those movies in the input array with a rating of "PG". You may assume the input array is full of Film instances. The returned array need not be full.

d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Film with the title “Valimai”, the production “Zee Studios”, and the rating “PG­13”

e) Write an implementation class to test the Film class.
