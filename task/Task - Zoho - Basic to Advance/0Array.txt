1.Write a Java program to sort a numeric array and a string array.

2.Write a Java program to add two matrices of the same size.

3.Write a Java program to find the sum of the two elements of a given array which is equal to a given integer.

Sample array: [1,2,4,5,6]

Target value: 6.

4.Write a Java program to print all the LEADERS in the array.   

Note: An element is leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side.

5. Write a Java program to sort an array of positive integers of a given array, in the sorted array the value of the first element should be maximum, second value should be minimum value, third should be second maximum, fourth second be second minimum and so on.

6.Write a Java program to replace every element with the next greatest element (from right side) in a given array of integers. There is no element next to the last element, therefore replace it with -1.

7. Write a Java program to check if a given array contains a subarray with 0 sum

Input :

nums1= { 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }

nums2 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }

nums3 = { 1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 6 }

Output:

Does the said array contain a subarray with 0 sum: true

Does the said array contain a subarray with 0 sum: false

Does the said array contain a subarray with 0 sum: true

8.Write a Java program to check if a sub-array is formed by consecutive integers from a given array of integers.

Input :

nums = { 2, 5, 0, 2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 1, 0 }

Output:

The largest sub-array is [1, 7]

Elements of the sub-array: 5 0 2 1 4 3 6

9.Given two sorted arrays A and B of size p and q, write a Java program to merge elements of A with B by maintaining the sorted order i.e. fill A with first p smallest elements and fill B with remaining elements.

Input :

int[] A = { 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 }

int[] B = { 2, 4, 9 }

Output:

Sorted Arrays:

A: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]

B: [8, 9, 10]

10.. Write a Java program to form the largest number from a given list of non negative integers.

Example:

Input :

nums = {1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 6}

Output:

Largest number using the said array numbers: 643210
