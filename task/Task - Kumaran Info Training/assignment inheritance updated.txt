Q1)Inheritance - Booking Tickets

 

Whether you fly for business or leisure purposes, you can choose either private jets or
 commercial airlines to get from point A to point B. 

The task is to get the flight details and display them. Write a Java program to Implement this task. 

Consider a class Aircraft

Include the following protected data members/attributes: 

Data Type	Variable Name 
String	aircraftName 
String	source
String	destination
Include getters/ setters. 

Include the following public methods

Prototype for the Parameterized Constructor, 

public Aircraft(String aircraftName,String source,String destination) 
 

Include the following method.

Method Name	Description
void display()	The return type of this method is void, this method prints the details of the Aircraft
 

Consider a class PublicAircraft that extends Aircraft

Include the following private attributes/data members: 

Data Type	Variable Name 
Boolean	checkInBeforeTwoHours
int	noOfKgsAllowed
Double	additionalFeePerkg
Here checkInBeforeTwoHours is a Boolean value that says whether the passenger should check-in before two
 hours or not.

This flag is true in the case of PublicAircraft. 

Include getters/ setters. 

Include the following public methods 

Prototype for the Parameterized Constructor,
public PublicAircraft(String aircraftName,String source,String destination,Boolean checkInBeforeTwoHours ,int noOfKgsAllowed,float additionalFeePerkg) 

Include the following method.

Method Name	Description
void display( )	This method prints the details of the booking done for the Public aircraft
 

Consider a class PrivateAircraft that extends Aircraft

Include the following private attributes: 

Data Type	Variable Name 
Boolean	checkInBeforeTwoHours
String	pilotPreference
String	purpose
Here checkInBeforeTwoHours is a Boolean value that says whether the passenger should check-in before two hours or not.
This flag is false in the case of PrivateAircraft. 

Here, pilot preferences is a string for which the name of the pilot should be given by the passenger according to his preference.

Purpose is a string that indicates the purpose of the flight (Medical,Personal,Cargo)

Include getters/ setters.

Prototype for the Parameterized Constructor,
public PrivateAircraft(String aircraftName,String source,String destination,Boolean checkInBeforeTwoHours,String pilotPreference ,String  purpose ) 

 

Include the following method.

Method Name	Description
void display( )	This method prints the details of the booking done for the Public aircraft
 

Consider a Main class to test the classes defined above. 

All the float values should be displayed up to 2 decimal places.

All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output.

2.)Abstract Class 

Abstract classes are declared with a keyword abstract. These classes cannot be instantiated. They can have attributes/methods. They can have normal methods as well as abstract methods. These abstract methods must be implemented in subclasses or else they should also be declared as abstract. 

Write a program to calculate the perimeter of Circle, Rectangle, and square which implements the abstract class attributes/methods.

Strictly adhere to the Object-Oriented specifications given in the problem statement. All class names, attribute names and method names should be the same as specified in the problem statement.


Create an abstract class Shape with abstract method public abstract Double calculatePerimeter()

Consider a class Circle that extends Shape with the following private attributes,

Attribute	Datatype
radius	Float
Include appropriate getters and setters, constructors for the class.

Create a parameterized constructor with an argument in order public Circle(Float radius).

Consider a class Rectangle that extends Shape with the following private attributes,

Attribute	Datatype
length	Float
breadth	Float
Include appropriate getters and setters, constructors for the class.
Prototype for the Parameterized Constructor, public Rectangle(Float length, Float breadth).

Consider  a class Square that extends Shape with the following private attributes,

Attribute	Datatype
side	Float
Include appropriate getters and setters, constructors for the class.

Prototype for the Parameterized Constructor, public Square (Float side).


Implement the method calculatePerimeter() in all the child classes to calculate appropriate perimeters.

Note: Use 3.14 for pi value

All the double values should be displayed up to 2 decimal places.
Refer to sample Input and Output for formatting specifications.


Sample Input and Output 1:

List of Shapes:
1.Circle
2.Rectangle
3.Square
Enter your choice:
1
Enter the radius of the Circle:
2.34
The perimeter is 14.70

Sample Input and Output 2:

List of Shapes:
1.Circle
2.Rectangle
3.Square
Enter your choice:
2
Enter the length of the Rectangle:
12
Enter the breadth of the Rectangle:

3.)Account Details 
 
Write a Java program to display the Account details using inheritance class and methods.
 
Consider a class Account with the following private attributes/variables.

Data Type	Variable
String	holderName
Long	accountNumber
String	IFSCCode
Long	contactNumber
Include appropriate getters and setters, constructors for the class.

Prototype for the Parameterized Constructor,
public Account(String holderName, Long accountNumber, String IFSCCode, Long contactNumber)


The class Account should have the following method

Method Name	Description
public void display()	This method displays account details in the following order holderName, accountNumber, IFSCCode and contactNumber

 

Consider class SavingsAccount which extends Account class with the following private attributes/variables.

Data Type	Variable
Double	interestRate
 

The SavingsAccount class include the following method

Method Name	Description
public void display()	Invokes the base class display() and in addition displays interestRate
Include appropriate getters and setters, constructors for the class.

Prototype for the Parameterized Constructor,
public SavingAccount(String holderName, Long accountNumber, String IFSCCode, Long contactNumber, Double interestRate)
Use super Keyword to call the base class constructor.

Consider class CurrentAccount which extends Account class with the following private attributes/variables.

Data Type	Variable
String	organizationName
Long	TIN

The CurrentAccount class include the following method

Method Name	Description
 public void display()	Invokes base class display() and in addition displays organizationName,TIN
Include appropriate getters and setters, constructors for the class.

Prototype for the Parameterized Constructor,
public CurrentAccount(String holderName, Long accountNumber, String IFSCCode, Long contactNumber, String organizationName, Long TIN)

Note: Use super Keyword to call the base class constructor.

Consider a Main class with the main() method, get user details in comma separated format in the following order (Holder name, Account Number, IFSC code, Contact Number).
Display the Account Details by calling a method of the base class with a child class object.
