Create an abstract class Instrument which is having the abstract function play. 
Create three more sub classes from Instrument which is Piano, Flute, Guitar.
Override the play method inside all three classes printing a message 
“Piano is playing  tan tan tan tan  ”  for Piano class
“Flute is playing  toot toot toot toot”  for Flute class
“Guitar is playing  tin  tin  tin ”  for Guitar class 
You must not allow the user to declare an object of Instrument class.
Create an array of 10 Instruments.
Assign different type of instrument to Instrument reference.
Check for the polymorphic behavior of  play method.
Use the instanceof operator to print that which object stored at which index of instrument array.

Create an abstract class Compartment to represent a rail coach. Provide an abstract function notice in this class. 
Derive FirstClass, Ladies, General, Luggage classes from the compartment class. 
Override the notice function in each of them to print notice suitable to the type of the compartment.
Create a class TestCompartment . Write main function to do the following:
Declare an array of Compartment of size 10.
Create a compartment of a type as decided by a randomly generated integer in the range 1 to 4.
Check the polymorphic behavior of the notice method.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a package called test package;
Define a class called foundation inside the test package; 
Inside the class, you need to define 4 integer variables; 
Var1 as private; 
Var2 as default; 
Var3 as protected; 
Var4 as public; 
Import this class and packages in another class. 
Try to access all 4 variables of the foundation class and see what variables are accessible and what are not accessible.

Write an interface called Playable, with a method
void play();
Let this interface be placed in a package called music.
Write a class called Veena which implements Playable interface. Let this class be placed in a package music.string
Write a class called Saxophone which implements Playable interface. Let this class be placed in a package music.wind
Write another class Test in a package called live. Then,
a. Create an instance of Veena and call play() method
b. Create an instance of Saxophone and call play() method
c. Place the above instances in a variable of type Playable and then call play()
